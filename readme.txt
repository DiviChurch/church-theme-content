Provides compatible themes with church-related post types, taxonomies and custom fields. A compatible theme is required for displaying content.

== Description ==

= Who this is for =

This plugin is intended for a very specific audience. If you are not one of the below, then this plugin will not be useful to you.

* Users of themes made by [churchthemes.com](http://churchthemes.com)
* Users of themes from other providers made *specifically* for use with this plugin
* Developers wanting to improve data portability among church WordPress sites

= What it does =

It enables users to manage **sermons, events, people and locations** that a compatible theme can display. 

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only to control the look and feel of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin. This plugin also follows [Church WordPress Standards](http://cwps.churchthemes.com) for improved data portability.

= Developers =

Please see the plugin's [GitHub](https://github.com/churchthemes/church-theme-functionality) repository for notes on developing themes that use this plugin.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
