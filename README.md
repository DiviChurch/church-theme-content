Church Theme Content (Plugin)
=============================

A WordPress plugin from [churchthemes.com](https://churchthemes.com) providing compatible themes with church-related post types, taxonomies and fields.

Purpose
-------

Church Theme Content provides functionality enabling the user to manage *sermons*, *events*, *people* and *locations* to be displayed by a compatible theme.

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only to control the appearance of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin. Similarly, our approach is not to display content using the plugin since themes offer more control for that purpose.
