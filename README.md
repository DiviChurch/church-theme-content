Church Theme Functionality (Plugin)
===================================

A WordPress plugin that provides compatible themes with church-related post types, taxonomies and custom fields.

Purpose
-------

This plugin enables the user to manage *sermons*, *events*, *people* and *locations* to be displayed by a compatible theme.

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only to control the appearance of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin. Similarly, our approach is not to display content using the plugin since themes offer more control for that purpose.

Developers
----------

This plugin was made in a way that other church theme developers can take advantage of it. A couple benefits are that you will save time and be helping to accomplish better data portability among church websites powered by WordPress.
