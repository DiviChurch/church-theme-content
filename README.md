Church Theme Content (Plugin)
=============================

A WordPress plugin from [churchthemes.com](http://churchthemes.com) providing compatible themes with church-related post types, taxonomies and fields.

Purpose
-------

Church Theme Content provides functionality enabling the user to manage *sermons*, *events*, *people* and *locations* to be displayed by a compatible theme.

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only to control the appearance of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin. Similarly, our approach is not to display content using the plugin since themes offer more control for that purpose.

Visit the [plugin's page on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content) for more information.

Developers
----------

The Church Theme Content plugin was made in a way that other church theme developers can take advantage of it. A couple benefits are that you will save time and be helping to accomplish better data portability among church websites powered by WordPress.
