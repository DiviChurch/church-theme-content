Church Theme Functionality Plugin
=================================

A WordPress plugin that provides compatible themes with church-related post types, taxonomies and custom fields.

Purpose
-------

This plugin enables the user to manage sermons, events, people and locations that a compatible theme can display. 

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only to control the look and feel of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin. This plugin also follows [Church WordPress Standards](http://cwps.churchthemes.com) for improved data portability.

Developers
----------

This plugin was made primarily for themes developed by [churchthemes.com](http://churchthemes.com). However, it was made in a way that other developers can take advantage of it as well. A couple benefits are that you will save time and be helping to accomplish better data portability among church websites powered by WordPress.
